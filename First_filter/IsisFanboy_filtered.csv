Anyone with a mustard's grain worth of faith in his heart would prefer a million times hand over Mare'... (9) 
... to IS who implements Sharia and rules with Islam instead of giving it to the PKK. (10) 
They wanted to revolt against Bashar and they ended up being slaves to the Tawaghit and their puppet agents. Well done! (11) 
"They didn't bring safety, they didn't implement Sharia, they didn't spread justice, they didn't implement hudud, they didn't liberate.. (12) "
"they didn't keep any land they liberated, they didn't unify with each other, they didn't rock the Nusayris, they didn't lift.. (13) "
.. any siege on anything. You couldn't find one single one of them ready to sacrifice himself for the sake of Allah to defend Mare'. (14) 
"Worthless apostate rats calling themselves ""Mujahideen"" anding over Mare' to the Islamic State no, but handing it over to the PKK yes? (15) "
"A ""so-called state"", an ""organization"", with limited resources, fighting the whole world for 2 years, didn't give away any city except (16) "
"with fierce resistance and dozens of fighters sacrificing themselves, and here you have factions with support (17) "
from big Arab countries who couldn't fight for 2 days (18) 
"O Rebels! If you gave Mare' to IS, reinforcements would have come to it all the way from the outskirts of Baghdad and Mosul (19) "

How long do you think the ceasefire will stand in #Syria? 
Be careful; aim of #Syria ceasefire is to launch massive concentrated offensive in Jarabulus-Afrin strip north #Syria by #USA #Russia & #YPG 
#Russia|ns and #USA agreed first and most important objective during ceasefire is sealing #Turkey #Syria|n borders end to end at any cost.. 
Ceasefire has been intentionally delayed until #YPG secured Tell Rifaat (front line with #ISIS) & to secure more ground this week.. #Syria

"Tariq bin Ziyad to conquer Andhlusia, Qateeba to conquer Turkmenistan, as well as another warrior to conquer Africa. "
"With death of Waleed, the new Umayad ruler called Muhammad bin Qasim, Qateeba, Tariq bin Ziyad back, "
"otherwise they'd have conquered more lands, including entire China, Europe, Africa etc. "
"And there is bad side : Hajjaj bin Yousuf used to spill unlawfull muslim blood, he killed more than 1 lakh muslims "
"Among those Hajjaj bin Yousuf killed included last of sahabah (RA), many scholars and pious muslims. "
"Some scholars made takfeer on Hajjaj bin Yousuf, some didn't. "

"Yet some scholars look at his good side of conquests, and introducing signs in Quran and excuse him for spilling unlawfull blood "
"Many of the heroes of this Ummah like Muhammad bin Qasim, Tariq bin Ziyad, Qateeba were treated by their rulers like Osama was treated. "
"As per Imam Abu Haneefah, the Khilafah of Umayads and Abassids was baatil (& not upon the methodology of Prophethood) "
Imam Abu Haneefah supported rebellion against rulers of his time. 
"Abu Haneefah supported rebellion of Muhammad Nafs Zakiyyah, Ibrahim Nafs Mardiyyah, descends of Ali RA against Abassids"
"because they wanted to establish Khilafah al manhajju Nabuwa, and they did so in lands they captured. "
Imam Abu Haneefah told it's better to fight alongside Muhammad & Ibrahim against ruler than to fight disbelievers. 
"Also Abu Haneefah supported the rebellion of Zayd bin Ali bin Hussain, the grand son of Imam Hussain, to whom Zaydis attribute themselves "
"Zayd bin Ali bin Hussain requested Abu Haneefah for manpower to which Abu Haneefah replied, "
"If I knew Kufans would not betray you, I'd definitely support you, but they even betrayed Ali, Hassan & Hussain RA. "

"@FidaeeFulaani notice the narrator says ""the lion shaykh"" He's far from a lion character... "
"thus Kufans (the fore fathers of shia) repeated with grandson of Hussain RA, Zayd bin Ali bin Hussain, what they did to Hussain RA. "

What happened to the Muslims in Shaam in this day & age should wake up any Muslim who has a heart & cares about the believers 
The filthy Kuffar are paving the way for a mass-murderer (Bashar) who is responsible for 95% of the deaths that occurred 
Their hatred for the religion of Allah & His Sharia is so great that they would rather have Bashar as a Ruler no matter how many Muslims die 
#Nusra/ Ahrar and other Rebels Offensive on #Syrian Army Positions near Strategic #TelEiis Town in Southern #Aleppo. https://www.facebook.com/unsupportedbrowser 
Their hatred for the religion of Allah is so severe that an intervention happened only after the Sharia of Allah was established 
The Kuffar united every single enemy of Allah & dropped them in a cursed coalition to bomb the Muslims day & night. Is this not hatred?

"@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar Pragmatism is required, especially with the West, on issues of interests. The loud voice, anger, and narcissism are of no use in the interests policy"
@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar Erdogan will not find a suitable alternative to Oglu to address the West and Iran in particular .. I think his international isolation days are close ..

1. Ayman Zawahiri's latest video implies Jabhat Al-Nusra has permission to leave Al-Qaeda and merge with US-sponsored Syrian rebel groups. 
2. The groups he suggested that Nusra join have already shown their willingness to work under US/Saudi/Turkish orders and renounce Shariah. 
3. The Syrian rebel groups have shown their willingness to renounce Shariah and work under US orders. My article: https://conflictreporters.wordpress.com/2016/04/08/the-changing-face-of-syrias-jihadists/ 
"4. So this poses the question, has Ayman Zawahiri renounced Jihadist teachings to ""raise the word of Allah above all""? "
5. Or is Ayman Zawahiri simply ignorant about the nature of the Syrian rebels he calls Nusra to merge with and thus guilty of being naive? 
"6. Either way, it suggests that Ayman Zawahiri will no longer be seen as relevant by Jihadists who will see him as out of touch and ""soft"". "
