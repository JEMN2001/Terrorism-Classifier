"With death of Waleed, the new Umayad ruler called Muhammad bin Qasim, Qateeba, Tariq bin Ziyad back,"
"otherwise they'd have conquered more lands, including entire China, Europe, Africa etc."
"And there is bad side : Hajjaj bin Yousuf used to spill unlawfull muslim blood, he killed more than 1 lakh muslims"
"Among those Hajjaj bin Yousuf killed included last of sahabah (RA), many scholars and pious muslims."
"Some scholars made takfeer on Hajjaj bin Yousuf, some didn't."

"As per Imam Abu Haneefah, the Khilafah of Umayads and Abassids was baatil (&amp; not upon the methodology of Prophethood)"
Imam Abu Haneefah supported rebellion against rulers of his time.

"because they wanted to establish Khilafah al manhajju Nabuwa, and they did so in lands they captured."
Imam Abu Haneefah told it's better to fight alongside Muhammad &amp; Ibrahim against ruler than to fight disbelievers.
"Also Abu Haneefah supported the rebellion of Zayd bin Ali bin Hussain, the grand son of Imam Hussain, to whom Zaydis attribute themselves"
"Zayd bin Ali bin Hussain requested Abu Haneefah for manpower to which Abu Haneefah replied,"

#BreakingNews In a rare denial statement #ISIS-linked #Aamaq denies #USA claimس of killing Shishani.. #Syria #Iraq https://t.co/GhSHM4JuXd
The #AmaqAgency news agency denies the Pentagon claim that IS commander Umar Shishani was killed and also confirms that he was not injured.
Probably the first ever official statement denying death of a very high ranking #ISIS Commander. They didn't even issue one for Baghdadi..

The Madkhalite-Salafist sect of Islam is very pro-West. It's similar to the early Kharijite school as it favors non-Muslims over Muslims.
@ WarReporter1 Madkhalies are Khawarij to Muslim Ummah and Murjiah to their rulers
We as Muslims do not need any surrogate of justice like democracy. We realize that justice is possible only under Shariah.

The filthy Kuffar are paving the way for a mass-murderer (Bashar) who is responsible for 95% of the deaths that occurred

"The Iranians are very proud of their culture even though they know that the Persian Empire was one of the greatest enemies of the Sahaba,"
they use a flag which was designed by an empire which killed hundreds of the Sahaba and thousands of Muslims.

"@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar Indeed, in my view, Erdogan is a dictator, regardless of his accomplishments, and he has a very high narcissism, and I think Davutoglu is more pragmatic than him."
@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar And the West sees it as good interlocutor who has constants but is not stubborn and his head is dry like Erdogan. Oglu calculates the issue of negotiating with Europe
"@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar Yes, refugees and European governments, and Merkel is much more comfortable than Erdoانan .."
"@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar If Ihsanoglu really resigns, then Erdogan and his party will be considered a political fallen party and perhaps this is what the West wants. I don&#39;t know if Ihsanoglu will leave"
"@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar The party also, but I think this will not happen unless there is a coup inside the party on Erdogan and I think it is close"
"@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar Pragmatism is especially needed with the West on interest issues. Loud voice, anger, and narcissism are of no use in interest politics"
@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar Erdogan will not find a suitable alternative to Oglu to address the West and Iran in particular .. I think his international isolation days are close ..
"@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar Take an example of the issue of the Israeli ship Erdogan, he wants to keep it open forever, because of his interests in the Islamic world"
"@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar Ihsanoglu wants to gain interests from it and move it, and indeed the case has moved and there are signs of ending it, but Erdogan narcissist refuses to do it."
@ WW3ISkoming @MousaAlomar I hope that Turkey does not slip because of the signs of political division because the West is ready for the alternative and they are the Kurds and the opposition and its hour. God have mercy on everyone

1. Ayman Zawahiri's latest video implies Jabhat Al-Nusra has permission to leave Al-Qaeda and merge with US-sponsored Syrian rebel groups.
2. The groups he suggested that Nusra join have already shown their willingness to work under US/Saudi/Turkish orders and renounce Shariah.
3. The Syrian rebel groups have shown their willingness to renounce Shariah and work under US orders. My article: https://t.co/TG5s8o6E6s
"4. So this poses the question, has Ayman Zawahiri renounced Jihadist teachings to ""raise the word of Allah above all""?"
5. Or is Ayman Zawahiri simply ignorant about the nature of the Syrian rebels he calls Nusra to merge with and thus guilty of being naive?
"6. Either way, it suggests that Ayman Zawahiri will no longer be seen as relevant by Jihadists who will see him as out of touch and ""soft""."
