1. Ayman Zawahiri's latest video implies Jabhat Al-Nusra has permission to leave Al-Qaeda and merge with US-sponsored Syrian rebel groups.
2. The groups he suggested that Nusra join have already shown their willingness to work under US/Saudi/Turkish orders and renounce Shariah.
3. The Syrian rebel groups have shown their willingness to renounce Shariah and work under US orders. My article: https://t.co/TG5s8o6E6s
"4. So this poses the question, has Ayman Zawahiri renounced Jihadist teachings to ""raise the word of Allah above all""?"
5. Or is Ayman Zawahiri simply ignorant about the nature of the Syrian rebels he calls Nusra to merge with and thus guilty of being naive?
"6. Either way, it suggests that Ayman Zawahiri will no longer be seen as relevant by Jihadists who will see him as out of touch and ""soft""."

1. Ayman Zawahiri's latest video implies Jabhat Al-Nusra has permission to leave Al-Qaeda and merge with US-sponsored Syrian rebel groups. 
2. The groups he suggested that Nusra join have already shown their willingness to work under US/Saudi/Turkish orders and renounce Shariah. 
3. The Syrian rebel groups have shown their willingness to renounce Shariah and work under US orders. My article: https://conflictreporters.wordpress.com/2016/04/08/the-changing-face-of-syrias-jihadists/ 
"4. So this poses the question, has Ayman Zawahiri renounced Jihadist teachings to ""raise the word of Allah above all""? "
5. Or is Ayman Zawahiri simply ignorant about the nature of the Syrian rebels he calls Nusra to merge with and thus guilty of being naive? 
"6. Either way, it suggests that Ayman Zawahiri will no longer be seen as relevant by Jihadists who will see him as out of touch and ""soft"". "
